# Artificial-Neural-Network-Numpy
This is a simple multi layer perceptron (mlp) or well knows as artificial neural network framework written in native python and only using numpy array library.
this framework also provides 4 optimization algorithms. run MLP_main.py to run MLP model, run data.py to generate dummy data.

layer files are activation_relu.py, activation_softmax.py, layer_dense.py, and loss.py
optimizer object classes are in optimizer.py file
other files are experimental files so feel free to try write your own model!

# 🖥️ 4 works optimizer
- SGD
- RMS_prop
- Adagrad
- Adam(combination of RMSprop and adagrad)
