# Artificial-Neural-Network-Numpy
This is a simple multi layer perceptron (mlp) or well knows as artificial neural network framework written in native python and using numpy array library
this framework also included 4 optimization algorithm. run MLP_main.py to run MLP model, run data.py to generate dummy data.

layer files are activation_relu.py, activation_softmax.py, layer_dense.py, and loss.py
optimizer object classes are in optimizer.py file

# üñ•Ô∏è 4 works optimizer
- SGD
- RMS_prop
- Adagrad
- Adam(combination of RMSprop and adagrad)
